# Compatibility with sd2vita adapter

This plugin is not compatible with sd2vita adapter and corresponding gamesd.skprx plugin.

This plugin is not compatible with any other kernel plugin that is derived from gamesd.skprx.

If you are going to use this plugin - disable gamesd.skprx

Ideally it is recommented to remove sd2vita adapter. However when inserted - it should be ignored by this plugin.

**Integration with sd2vita is planned for next release.**
